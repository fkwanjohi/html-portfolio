<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Freddie. I was born in Kenya and raised in the USA from when I was 7yrs old. I graduated from the University of Connecticut as a General Studies major with focus on Economics and minor in Business Fundamentals. While on a break from school, I interned for a marketing firm, Vittori Group, in New York City which I went on to work with full time. I worked in direct sales and marketing for 4yrs while having the opportunity to also work in Toronto, Canada, Rochester, NY, Orlando, FL and Philadelphia, PA.</p>
<p>During my time with Vittori Group, I was able to greatly improve on my communication and leadership skills as I learned to interact with people from variety of different backgrounds while working with telecommunication, retail, and tech companies. After 4yrs, I felt it was time for a career change, but I was not quite sure which field would be right for me. I had an opportunity to work as the lead of a social media marketing team for LiquidX Studio, based in Malaysia. I enjoyed the experience as it allowed me to work remote and be free to travel. I even had the opportunity to represent the company at a conference in Los Angeles, CA.</p>
<p>It was then that I decided to research careers in the tech industry as I came across various individuals in the industry who worked remotely. I had considered Computer Science during my undergrad, but I never pursued it. After researching different roles and career tracks, I made the commitment to enroll in a few online courses in web development and programming. I have thus completed a HTML course and currently enrolled in a web development bootcamp.</p>
